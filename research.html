        Research

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> I'm interested in topics in problem-solving, concepts, causalilty, and I like to appoach these subjects through methodologies in cognitive & developemental psychology, analytical philosophy, artificial intelligence, and cognitive linguistics.  <br><br>
            Involvement in labwork has been pivotal in developing these interests. Last fall, I worked with PhD candidates Pouria Saffaran and Konstantinos Xanthios and provided background on literature on fear emotions, PTSD, and problem-solving for a grant application we are still waiting back on.  
            I've also been in the proccess of coding a comprehensive signed language database with Oksana Tkachman and another RA, my friend Hassan, researching spatial frames of reference in signed languages. 
            Most recently, I started an RA position at the Language and Learning Lab led by Patricia Ganea, where I'm assisting Ioana Grosu with her study on counterfactual reasoning, as well as planning my own study! <br> <br>

            Currently, I'm very fixated on modelling causality which I'm looking into through an independent study supervised by Sara Aronowitz. As a mere novice of the cognitive science, I assume my interests will go through more epic developements throughout my undergrad!
