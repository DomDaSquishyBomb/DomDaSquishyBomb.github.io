    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>During my time as an undergraduate (ongoing and strong), I've had a few opportunities to help with research and
        lead some independent projects to explore my interests in the cognitive sciences. While my knowledge base
        significantly grows with every course I endure, the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science is very
        fitting to how I like to explore each topic of interest. The topics that interest me the most right now are
        causal reasoning, counterfactual thinking, cognitive development, and cognitive architectures .</p>

    <p>Specifically, I'm curious about <i>what underlying structures could represent mental objects and relationships
            when we reason about them? How do children translate everyday language into causal models to explain and
            predict events? Why do alternative and fictional worlds seem so intuitive, and what does that say about our
            cogware? </i></p>

    <p>
        I'm very fortunate to have worked under the mentorship of <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/ska/">Sara Aronowitz</a>, <a href="https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/23831-patricia-ganea">Patricia Ganea</a>, <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/ioana_grosu/">Ioana Grosu</a>, <a href="https://canmekik.ca/">Can Mekik</a>. Also shoutout to my friends, fellow RAs, and lab managers at the <a href="https://languageandlearninglab.com/">Language and Learning Lab</a> who taught me so much, including how to run experiments :)
