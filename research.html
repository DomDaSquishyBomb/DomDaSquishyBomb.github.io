        <h1>Research</h1>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I'm interested in learning about how children and adults reason. </p>
        <p> Currently, I'm investigating the efficacy of modeling causal reasoning as a form of conditional reasoning using counterfactuals. Counterfactuals are events that did not happen, but could have happened if the past had been different. For some two events that follow each other in time, if they are dependent, then the absence of one would affect prescence of the other. This is the idea that motivates the utility of counterfactual analysis in understanding causal dependencies in a variety of scientific fields, and it may also underlie how we reason about the world. I'm hopping to understand where this process is situated in human cognition, whether it is lower or higher cognitive process, and how it works. </p>  

        <p>Through independent studies, I've received advisorship from Ioana Grosu, Patricia Ganea, Sara Aronowitz, and Can Mekik</p>
        
        <p>As for labwork, I RAd at the Language and Learning Lab at University of Toronto, where I recruited participants, designed stimuli and materials, tested participants, and conducted statistical analyses.  I also RAd for Oksana Tkachman, where I coded signed language data and presented work on a novel spatial framework for frames of reference in signed language</p>
