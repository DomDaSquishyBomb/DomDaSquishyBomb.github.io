              <h2>Hello, </h2>
              <p> 
                My name is Dominic Le. I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the Industrious University of Toronto, Canada. I double major in Cognitive Science (Computational Stream) and Psychology with a minor in Linguistics.

                I was raised in the Great Harbour City of <a href="https://www.nanaimo.ca/about-nanaimo/nanaimo-bars" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Nanaimo, British Columbia</a> where I spent my teenage years cultivating a youth music scene with my friends by playing in bands and hosting shows. I also spent my free time going on hikes and building improvised shelters in the woods which is nice because there is a lot of <span style="color: rgb(45, 128, 0);">green</span> outside, and my favourite colour is <span style="color: green;">green</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nowadays, I spend my free time researching topics in cognitive science such as <i> <a class="tooltip">counterfactual thinking<span class="tooltiptext">Def: thinking about events that did not happen</span> </a></i>  through behavioural experiments with adults + children and philosophy independent study. I still play music from time to time and I like to write about the history of DIY music movements.
