Inspiration for Spring
Sep -26 2023

The sand send its mixed messaging
Does everything you think not punish me
This city’s so tall but it’s beautiful to have stars replaced with hi hats ringing right in-front of my face
Non of my plans have a planner, youre from the midwest and we met to celebrate we will take neither each other’s breath
I’ve tried to cry and I’ve tried to hide, there is everything in nothing is not winning, you doofus
Demoralized by humankind, he sits on top of his mattress
life in a box belong to the way his neighbors talk
they’re too afraid to stop the alarm
There will be answers in my life
