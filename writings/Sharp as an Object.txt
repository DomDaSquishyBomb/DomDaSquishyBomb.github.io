Sharp as an Object
Apr 9 2023

It was the colour of shellac
That fattest test was the final
She wrote a larger request
The Doc was leaving tomorrow

How long of waiting do I get
Whispered the soilless houseplants
Before the girl gets the dirt on us

My friends asked them for help
He tripped and he crawled to the front desk
He prayed theyd still see him again
This is the current state of our hometown
Youd think hed stop believing it
Start at the heart like a little kid
His star like eyes to dig into it
Pull out the knife poc kids pocket

How long of waiting do I get
Whispered the soilless houseplants
No use in drinking my sweat
Unless watching are dirty guests
