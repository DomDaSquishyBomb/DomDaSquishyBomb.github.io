                    The guardian, spirit, and person: what happened? <br>
                    The three years it takes to lose everything, <br>
                    the 15 years of holding on to anything that looked like <br>
                    what you saw when you were in my position 30 years ago. <br>
                    I want a family of three and 90 thousand dollars a year; <br>
                    I'll have three favourite colours and three virtues I pass on to my kids; <br>
                    I'll give them simple digestible apt sentences; <br>
                    They'll grow up to be rich, to be old, and they won't need to take care of me. <br>
                    I will deduct from my conduct three ways my parents mistreated me, <br>
                    And I pass it off to the next family tree. <br>
                    I want nothing to do with my future, and I will accept all disease. <br>
                    You will be named three weeks before you are born, <br>
                    and until you are 18, I will lose 1/6 of myself every 3 years. <br> <br>

                    Seething is a piece of your blinding teeth, <br>
                    sliding flyers into pockets, activist creep. <br>
                    Recycle ideas from your failure set. <br>
                    Feel good; feel sad that no one else took care of your pet, <br>
                    I can't think of anything worse to forget. <br>
                    Failure set is the only set that makes no sense. <br>
                    <br>
                    Again, <br>
                    <br>
                    Capitalism overvalues beliefs <br>
                    Which automates the precedence of actions. <br>
                    Distance from parameters allows us to view them as categorically null. <br>
                    The only one responsible is the one casting blame. <br>
                    Of course they'd never win democratically; they're the most special person you've ever <br>
                    met. <br> <br>

                        Get a whiff of this, suck sharply. <br>
                        It's surfacing, dripping down the boundary of your toughness and your close-less <
                        considerations. <br>
                        Can I count this even if you never ended happy? <br>
                        Can we count this even if we never ended? <br>
                        Sadly, by the fern, the stiffness in your throat with unhurt ego only in shouting. <br>
                        Was the first, now the third; the gull to be exhausted sunshine's cooldown. <br>
                        Idiot! What if you sold my clothes or gifted your negativeness. <br>
                        If you watered your plants, your pets, every precious mayby. <br>
                        With the last throw; we are close now when sometimes you get to thinking, <br>
                        Please, from forever yours, can we have together dreams again? <br> <br>

            <h3>Best of Feb 29</h3>
            <p>
            Feb 29 2024 <br> <br>
            Back then, I wished porn was real. <br>
            Now, in the day, I wish I was still twice the age of David Suzuki's grandkid. <br>
            <br>
            Sympathy is never my strong suit - I will be sad with you - I will not pause what I see on Earth - Be upset that I'm not you all you want - There No Way You Can't Hear Me - I won't disagree. <br> 
            <br>
            Come to the Punk Show, Thomas. You need to see me now. <br>

                Sep 26 2023 <br> <br>
                The sand send its mixed messaging <br>
                Does everything you think not punish me <br>
                This city`s so tall but it`s beautiful to have stars replaced with hi-hats ringing right in-front of my face <br>
                None of my plans have a planner, you're from the midwest and we met to celebrate we will take neither each other`s breath <br>
                I`ve tried to cry and I`ve tried to hide, there is everything in nothing is not winning, you doofus <br>
                Demoralized by humankind, he sits on top of his mattress <br>
                life in a box belongs to the way his neighbors talk <br>
                they`re too afraid to stop the alarm <br>
                There will be answers in my life <br>

                Between every transition is love <br>
                'What is love if not anticipation' <br>
                What is anticipation if not expecting good <br>
                `Follow your heart` <br>
                Want only suffices to be good enough <br>

            <h3>Sharp as an Object</h3>
            <p class="">Apr 9 2023 <br> <br> 
                It was the colour of shellac <br>
                That fattest test was the final <br>
                She wrote a larger request <br>
                The Doc was leaving tomorrow <br>
                <br>
                How long of waiting do I get <br>
                Whispered the soilless houseplants <br>
                Before the girl gets the dirt on us <br>
                <br>
                My friends asked them for help <br>
                He tripped and he crawled to the front desk <br>
                He prayed theyd still see him again <br>
                This is the current state of our hometown <br>
                Youd think hed stop believing it <br>
                Start at the heart like a little kid <br>
                His star like eyes to dig into it <br>
                Pull out the knife poc kids pocket <br>
                <br>
                How long of waiting do I get <br>
                Whispered the soilless houseplants <br>
                No use in drinking my sweat <br>
                Unless watching are dirty guests</p>
