                <h3>Best of Feb 29</h3>
                <p>
                Feb 29 2024 <br> <br>
                Back then, I wished porn was real. <br>
                Now, in the day, I wish I was still twice the age of David Suzuki's grandkid. <br>
                <br>
                Sympathy is never my strong suit - I will be sad with you - I will not pause what I see on Earth - Be upset that I'm not you all you want - There No Way You Can't Hear Me - I won't disagree. <br> 
                <br>
                Come to the Punk Show, Thomas. You need to see me now. <br>

                The sand send its mixed messaging <br>
                Does everything you think not punish me <br>
                This city`s so tall but it`s beautiful to have stars replaced with hi-hats ringing right in-front of my face <br>
                None of my plans have a planner, you're from the midwest and we met to celebrate we will take neither each other`s breath <br>
                I`ve tried to cry and I`ve tried to hide, there is everything in nothing is not winning, you doofus <br>
                Demoralized by humankind, he sits on top of his mattress <br>
                life in a box belongs to the way his neighbors talk <br>
                they`re too afraid to stop the alarm <br>
                There will be answers in my life <br>

                Between every transition is love <br>
                'What is love if not anticipation' <br>
                What is anticipation if not expecting good <br>
                `Follow your heart` <br>
                Want only suffices to be good enough <br>

            <p>Apr 9 2023 <br> <br> 
                It was the colour of shellac <br>
                That fattest test was the final <br>
                She wrote a larger request <br>
                The Doc was leaving tomorrow <br>
                <br>
                How long of waiting do I get <br>
                Whispered the soilless houseplants <br>
                Before the girl gets the dirt on us <br>
                <br>
                My friends asked them for help <br>
                He tripped and he crawled to the front desk <br>
                He prayed theyd still see him again <br>
                This is the current state of our hometown <br>
                Youd think hed stop believing it <br>
                Start at the heart like a little kid <br>
                His star like eyes to dig into it <br>
                Pull out the knife poc kids pocket <br>
                <br>
                How long of waiting do I get <br>
                Whispered the soilless houseplants <br>
                No use in drinking my sweat <br>
                Unless watching are dirty guests</p>
