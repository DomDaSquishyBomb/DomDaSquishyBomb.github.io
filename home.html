    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Hello! I'm the Dominic in question and here is my introduction: <br><br>
        
        I'm a student at the University of Toronto studying to graduate with an H.B.Sc in 2026 and currently enrolled in Cognitive Science (Computational Cognition), Statistics, and Psychology.
        <br> <br>
        I spend most of my time on coursework, labwork, and independent research. In some form of CogSci spirit, I engage in philosophy, psychology, linguistics, AI (+ CS and Statistics) literature to learn more about how humans categorize concepts, causes and other cognitive proccesses.
        <br> <br>
        I'm also often an artist: I write music and poetry; create comedic media; and design this and that (like this site!). I like to emphasize absurdity and post-modernism, but I'm also inspired by americana which makes me reflect on my experiences growing up through socially and physically varying communities while being consistently online.
        <br> <br>
        Some cool statistics about me is that I've moved every 6 years of my life (from Saigon to Vancouver, to Nanaimo, to Toronto); I write music and in highschool released an indie-rock album with 9 songs; and as indicated on <a  href="presentations/CV Dominic Le 2024 June 5.pdf">my CV</a>, for the past 3 summers, I've worked in childcare.
