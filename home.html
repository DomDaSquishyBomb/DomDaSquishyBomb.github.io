    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Hello! I'm the Dominic in question and here is my introduction: <br><br>
        
        I'm a student at the University of Toronto studying to graduate with an H.B.Sc in 2026 and currently enrolled in Cognitive Science (Computational Cognition), Statistics, and Psychology.
        <br> <br>
        I'm a research assistant at Patricia Ganea's Language and Learning Lab where I'm assisting Ioana Grosu's study on overdetermination in different counterfactuals contexts. Here, I'm also co-leading a study investigating backtracking counterfactuals in language.
        <br> <br>
        I'm also currently exploring my interest in the cognitive science of causation and time through an independent study supervised by Sara Aronowitz.
        <br> <br>
        Some cool statistics about me is that I've moved every 6 years of my life (from Saigon to Vancouver, to Nanaimo, to Toronto); I write music and in highschool released an indie-rock album with 9 songs; and as indicated on <a  href="presentations/CV Dominic Le 2024 June 5.pdf">my CV</a>, for the past 3 summers, I've worked in childcare.
