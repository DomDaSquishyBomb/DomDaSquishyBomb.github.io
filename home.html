    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Hello! I'm the Dominic in question. <br><br>
        I'm currently studying Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. <br><br>
        I do research in cognitive development and computational cognitive science, focusing on causal and counterfactual reasoning. <br><br>
        I write music, essays, poetry, and love being involved in my local art community! <br><br>
