                    <h3>If I was Mr. Fantastic</h3>
                    <p>Sep 30, 2025</p>
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Why doesn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Fantastic">Mr. Fantastic</a> ever go <i>goo form</i>? <br>
                    You know, like a big blob of goo? <br>
                    He could pass through anything! <br>
                    And be so bouncy! <br>
                    If I was Mr. Fantastic, <br>
                    I would go <i>goo form</i> all the time. <br>
                    Man, I would so addicted to being a big blob of <i>goo</i>. <br>
                    I would just be like, <br>
                    "Hey, I'm Mr. Fantastic, <br>
                    check out my <i>goo form</i>!" <br>
                    And then I would just be like, <br>
                    "Whoa, look at me, I'm a big blob of goo!" <br>
                    I would be so addicted to going being a blob... <br>
                    My team would probably alienate me. <br>
                    It's okay though,  <br>
                    Because I'd be so wrapped up in my solo goo adventures that I wouldn't even notice. <br>
                    Then, I  would probably <i>have to</i> get a new moniker, <br>
                    With a new set of mannerisms, <br>
                    Like, a German accent, <br>
                    And get into techno music or something...<br>
                    But I wouldn't learn German, or anything, (cause I'm too busy being a blob of goo). <br>
                    Maybe after a while, maybe on Saturday afternoon, someone would recognize me and be like, <br>
                    "What happened to you, Mr. Fantastic?!"<br>
                    And I'd be like, (in a Hollywood German accent), <br>
                    "I'm no longer Mr.Fantastic, <br>
                    <i>Unts Unts Unts Unts,</i> <br>
                    I'm Mr. <i>Goo</i>-d". <br>
