                    Imagine that Confucius has been transported to modern times, is learning English, and that I am his personal assistant. <br>
                    Confucius is seating on the toilet and says to me: <br>
                    "Assistant, can you pass me the uh uh paper uh uh" <br>
                    "The paper, Tao?" I say <br>
                    He replies "No, I am Confucius."

                    <h3>If I was Mr. Fantastic</h3>
                    <p>Sep 30, 2025</p>

                    Why doesn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Fantastic">Mr. Fantastic</a> ever go <i>goo form</i>? <br>
                    You know, like a big blob of goo? <br>
                    He could pass through anything! <br>
                    And be so bouncy! <br>
                    If I was Mr. Fantastic, <br>
                    I would go <i>goo form</i> all the time. <br>
                    Man, I would so addicted to being a big blob of <i>goo</i>. <br>
                    At first, I would be like, <br>
                    "Hey, I'm Mr. Fantastic, <br>
                    and this situation calls for my <i>goo form</i>!" <br>
                    And then eventually, I would just show up to fights ready to <i>goo</i> <br>
                    I would be so addicted to going <i>goo form</i>... <br>
                    My team would start hating me, and eventually alienate me <br>
                    "Sorry, Reed, it's just starting to feel like we're water and oil." <br>
                    Of course, this is a very ambiguous callout coming from the Human Torch.<br>
                    Nevertheless, I'd be exiled and lose all of my lab funding. <br>
                    I would probably have to get a new gig. <br>
                    I  would probably <i>have to</i> get a new moniker. <br>
                    ... <br>
                    Maybe I'd get into techno music? <br>
                    Maybe spend my savings to fly to Berlin? <br>
                    ... <br>
                    Maybe after a while, maybe at some Berlin rave, a local will approach me to say<br>
                    "Hi, I loved you then as Mr. Fantastic, and I love you no less now as Mr. Goo-d"<br>
