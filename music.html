            Lore
        </h2>
        <p>Music is a big passion of mine! My parents played me a large variety of music they liked throughout my childhood; 
            My dad took me to guitar lessons at 8; I started writing joke songs when I was 11 and then sad songs when I
            was 13; And now, I write songs that belong to genres which I will never admit to... Currently I'm in a post-weezercore,
            garage-esque, post-emo-esque, nature loving band called Derwin. 
            <br> <br>
            I used to writes songs for and play in Nanaimo's Space Disco Band. Check out our 2022 album "First Time" on 
            <a href="https://spacediscoband.bandcamp.com/album/first-time">Bandcamp</a> with lyrics and everything!
            Also, here's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220408152833/https://spacediscoband.com/">website</a>
            I made for the band back in its prime.
            <br> <br>
            Sometimes, I go by DJ Dinosaurus.
