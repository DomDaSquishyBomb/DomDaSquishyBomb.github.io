            <p>
                Music is a big passion of mine! My parents played me a large variety of music they liked throughout my childhood; 
                My dad took me to guitar lessons at 8; I started writing joke songs around the age of 11 and then songs that were funny songs at 13.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was in a post-weezercore,
                garage-esque, post-emo-esque, nature loving band called Derwin, which <a href="https://demomagazine.ca/2024/10/25/an-interview-with-derwins-dominic-le/">recently disbanded</a>. 
            </p>

                I used to writes songs for and play in Nanaimo's Space Disco Band. Check out our 2022 album "First Time" on 
                <a href="https://spacediscoband.bandcamp.com/album/first-time">Bandcamp</a> with lyrics and everything!
                Also, here's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220408152833/https://spacediscoband.com/">website</a>
                I made for the band back in its prime.
